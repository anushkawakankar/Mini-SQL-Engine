# Mini-SQL-Engine
An SQL Engine using Python3.

Dataset:
1. csv files for tables.
a. If a file is : ​ File1.csv ​ , the table name would be File1
b. There will be no tab ​ separation or space ​ separation, so you are not required
to handle it but you have to make sure to take care of both csv file type
cases: the one where values are in double quotes and the one where values
are without quotes.
2. All the elements in files would be ​ only INTEGERS
3. A file named: ​ metadata.txt​ (note the extension) would be given to you which will
have the following structure for each table:
<begin_table>
<table_name>
<attribute1>
....
<attributeN>
<end_table>
